## Homework 4 Assignment: Multiple Linear Regression

### Assigned: October 3, 2024
### Due: October 14, 2024

Your fourth homework assignment focuses on Multiple Linear Regression. Please download the the GitHub repository and work on your local computer. Once completed, please commit the changes and push your local repository back to the master repository.

Your Homework 4 Repository should contain the following files: nutrition.dat, Homework4.ipynb, and README.md (this file). This data set is taken from the textbook. The first column of the dataset contains a text description of the food and is not to be used for modeling. The response variable is **CALORIES**. 

The first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is a Markdown cell that contains the title information for this assignment, and loads the data.

#### Problem 1, Cell 2

Enter the necessary Python code to fit a multiple linear regression model with all factors using the Statsmodel library.

#### Problem 2, Cell 3

In cell 3 (Markdown), list all of the factors that could be removed from the model based upong having a _p_-value less than 0.05.

#### Problem 3, Cell 4

Enter the necessary Python code to fit the reduced model found from your analysis in cells 2 and 3.

#### Problem 4, Cell 5

Enter the necessary Python code to construct ANOVA tables using the prepAnovaTable for the full and reduced models found in cells 2 and 4.

#### Problem 5, Cell 6

In cell 6 (Markdown), conduct a partial _F_-test using the information from cell 5. Clearly show the values of the test statistic, as well as the critical value for the hypothesis test and your conclusion regarding the set of factors being considered for removal from the model.

#### Problem 6, Cell 7

Enter the necessary Python code to perform a residual analysis for the reduced model found in cell 4.

#### Problem 7, Cell 8

In cell 8 (Markdown), interpret the results of the residual analysis performed in cell 7 and state whether all model assumptions are satisified or not satisfied.

#### Problem 8, Cell 9

Enter the necessary Python code to detect high-leverage and influential points.

#### Problem 9, Cell 10

In cell 10 (Markdown), provide a list of high-leverage and influential points.

#### Problem 10, Cell 11

Enter the necessary Python code to perform a forward selection analysis using all factors.

#### Problem 11, Cell 12

In cell 12 (Markdown), describe the best model founding using forward selection.

#### Problem 12, Cell 13

Enter the necessary Python code to perform a backwards selection analysis using all factors.

#### Problem 13, Cell 14

In cell 14 (Markdown), describe the best model founding using backwards selection.

#### Problem 14, Cell 15

Enter the necessary Python code to perform a stepwise selection analysis using all factors.

#### Problem 15, Cell 16

In cell 16 (Markdown), describe the best model founding using stepwise selection.

#### Problem 16, Cell 17

Enter the necessary Python code to perform  all subsets selection analysis using all factors.

#### Problem 17, Cell 18

In cell 18 (Markdown), describe the best model founding using all subsets selection.


#### Problem 18, Cell 19

In cell 19 (Markdown), summarize the results from cell 12, 14, 16, and 18. Select on model and justify your selection.
